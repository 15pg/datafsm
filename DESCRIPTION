Title: Estimating Finite State Machine Models
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: "John Nay <john.j.nay@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package implements a method for estimating interpretable
    models of dynamic decision-making that is described in a 2015 paper by John
    Nay and Jonathan Gilligan. This can be useful for designing empirically
    grounded agent models in game theoretic simulations and for gaining direct
    insight into dynamic decision processes. We use an efficient representation
    of a decision model and a genetic algorithm-based estimation process. This
    combination of representation and optimization is effective in modeling
    decision-making with experimental game data and observational international
    relations data.
