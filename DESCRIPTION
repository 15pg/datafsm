Description: This package implements a method for estimating interpretable
    models of dynamic decision-making that is described in a 2015 paper by John
    Nay and Jonathan Gilligan. This can be useful for designing empirically
    grounded agent models in game theoretic simulations and for gaining direct
    insight into dynamic decision processes. We use an efficient representation
    of a decision model and a genetic algorithm-based estimation process. This
    combination of representation and optimization has proven effective in
    modeling decision-making with experimental game data and observational
    international relations data. This work was supported by NSF grants
    EAR-1416964 and EAR-1204685.
