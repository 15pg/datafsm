Description: This R package implements our method for automatically
    generating models of dynamic decision-making that both have strong
    predictive power and are interpretable in human terms. This is
    useful for designing empirically grounded agent-based simulations
    and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes.
    We use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based
    estimation process to generate simple deterministic approximations that
    explain most of the structure of complex stochastic processes.
    This method, implemented in C++ and R, scales well to large data sets.
    We have applied the package to empirical data, and demonstrated the
    method's ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating
    data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying decision
    models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.
    These applications of the package are described in a 2015 working paper
    by John Nay and Jonathan Gilligan: ``Data-driven Dynamic Decision Models''.
    A user of our package can estimate models by providing their data in a
    common "panel data" matrix format. The package is designed to estimate any
    time series classification model that uses a small number of binary
    predictor variables and moves back and forth between the values of the
    outcome variable over time. Larger sets of predictor variables can be
    reduced to smaller sets with cross-validation. Although the predictor
    variables must be binary, a quantitative variable can be converted into
    binary by division of the observed values into high/low classes. Future
    releases of the package may include additional estimation methods to
    complement GA optimization. This work was supported by NSF grants
    EAR-1416964 and EAR-1204685.
