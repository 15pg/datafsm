Description: This package implements our method for automatically
    generating models of dynamic decision-making that both have strong
    predictive power and are interpretable in human terms.
    We use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based
    estimation process to generate simple deterministic approximations that
    explain most of the structure of complex stochastic processes.
    This method, implemented in C++ and R, scales well to large data sets.
    We have applied the package to empirical data, and demonstrated the
    method's ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating
    data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying decision
    models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.
    A user of our package can estimate models by providing their data in a
    common "panel data" format. The package is designed to estimate
    time series classification models that use a small number of binary
    predictor variables and move back and forth between the values of the
    outcome variable over time. Larger sets of predictor variables can be
    reduced to smaller sets with cross-validation. Although the predictor
    variables must be binary, a quantitative variable can be converted into
    binary by division of the observed values into high/low classes.
