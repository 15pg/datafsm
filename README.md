This R package -- by John Nay and Jonathan Gilligan -- implements our method for automatically generating models of dynamic decision-making that both have strong predictive power and are interpretable in human terms. This is useful for designing empirically grounded agent-based simulations and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes. We use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation process to generate simple deterministic approximations that explain most of the structure of complex stochastic processes. This method, implemented in C++ and R, scales well to large data sets. We have applied the package to empirical data, and demonstrated the method's ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying decision models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity. These applications of the package are described in a 2015 working paper by John Nay and Jonathan Gilligan: \`\`Data-driven Dynamic Decision Models''.

Check out the documentation for the main function of the package:

``` {.r}
?evolve_model
```

Create data and estimate model with that data:

``` {.r}
cdata <- data.frame(period = 1:5, outcome = c(1,2,1,1,1),
my.decision1 = c(1,0,1,1,1), other.decision1 = c(0,0,0,1,1))
(result <- evolve_model(cdata))
```

Use the summary method on the output of the evolve\_model function:

``` {.r}
summary(result)
```
