\item{x}{S4 ga_fsm object.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{object}{S4 ga_fsm object}

\item{digits}{Optional numeric vector length one for how many significant digits to
print, default is 3.}

\item{y}{not used.}

\item{maintitle}{optional character vector}

\item{action_label}{optional character vector same length as action vector,
where each ith element corresponds to what that ith element in the action
vector represents. This will be used to fill in the states (circles) of the
state transition matrix to be plotted.}

\item{transition_label}{optional character vector same length as number of
columns of state transition matrix.}

\item{curvature}{optional numeric vector specifying the curvature of the
  lines for a diagram of 2 or more states.}

\item{data}{data.frame that has columns named "period" and "outcome" (period
is the time period that the outcome action was taken), and the rest of the
columns are predictors, ranging from one to three predictors. All of the
(3-5 columns) should be named. The period and outcome columns should be
integer vectors and the columns with the predictor variable data should be
logical vectors (\code{TRUE, FALSE}). If the predictor variable data is not
logical, it will coerced to logical with \code{base::as.logical()}.}

\item{type}{Not currently used.}

\item{na.action}{Optional function.}
